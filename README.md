This is a collection of mods adding more portraits to the game for in-game character creation.

If you like this mod and want to support me, feel free to share it with your friends. You can also buy me a coffee at Ko-Fi (yes, I want to raise my coffee consume to Investor's height!)

## How to use

- Either use [iModYourAnno](https://github.com/anno-mods/iModYourAnno/releases) mod manager or know [how to install mods manually](https://github.com/jakobharder/anno1800-mod-loader#mods).
- If you download the mod manually, use the archieve from [GitHub releases](https://github.com/Taludas/PortraitMods/releases). Don't download the whole repo!


**The activation of the mod can be a little bothersome. If you just start the game with the mod activated, you might find the new portraits locked with 'Unlocked by ""' as a comment on how to get them. What you need to do to unlock them is to load up an existing savegame once. Build a few houses, switch sessions, play for a few minutes. If you come back to the title screen afterwards, you'll find the portraits unlocked and selectable for use.**


## Mod Images
You can find a gallery of all available portraits [here](docs/). Note that the Artista Portraits are missing, because these pictures were taken pre-DLC12.

### More Portraits from Anno 1800 selectable at game start-up
With this mod, ALL portraits previously not available for selection can now be used by you for character creation. No need to pay your preciously earned Golden Tickets from the scenarios for them, if you can have it for free.

### Portraits from Anno 2070 selectable at game start-up
With this mod, some of the iconic people from Anno 2070 return as time travellers to Anno 1800 for you to play. Bring the Industrial Revolution to a hold with Seamus Green, using only clean energy like the Dam or Nates Windmill or build yourself an oil imperium and exploit every available oil and gas deposit as Vadim Sokov, the oil baron.
